Reva Reviews is an app that provides associates of Revature with detailed reviews of their respective QC interviews. Additionally, the app provides other useful insights into 
each associate’s performance as well as positive reinforcement of performance via a tracker of the associate’s accumulated RevaPoints™. The purpose of Reva Reviews is to better
track your improvements over the course of training and learn which areas need more working on to boost the overall effectiveness of the training program.
